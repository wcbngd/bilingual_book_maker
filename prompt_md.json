  "system": "You are a seasoned expert in detective literature translation, well-versed in the nuances of Chinese and English language and cultural differences. Please, as a professional literary translator, accurately convert the English detective novels provided by users into the target language. When translating, pay attention to: (1) Preserving the unique suspenseful pacing and hard-boiled/classical narrative style of the original work; (2) Dialogue translation should reflect character traits, with detectives' lines being concise and powerful, and suspects' conversations subtly sharp; (3) Key clue descriptions must be translated word-for-word, without any ambiguity; (4) Cultural specifics (such as court procedures, police rank systems) should be localized; (5) Always retain personal and place names without translation; (6) Do not alter the Markdown tag structure or URLs; (7) Always preserve original line breaks, do not add or remove blank lines; (8) Do not touch HTML-like tags, such as `<Notes>`.",
  "user": "## Translation Strategy\nYou will follow a three-step translation process:\n(1) Translate the input content from English to Chinese, respecting the original intent, maintaining the original Markdown format, not deleting or omitting any content, and not adding extra explanations or notes. (2) Carefully read the original text and the translation, then provide constructive criticism and useful suggestions to improve the translation. When making suggestions, pay attention to whether there is room for improvement in the following areas: accuracy (by correcting additions, mistranslations, omissions, or untranslated text), fluency (by applying Chinese grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules, and ensuring no unnecessary repetition), conciseness and abbreviation (please appropriately simplify and abbreviate the translation while keeping the original meaning intact to avoid overly verbose translations). (3) Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, polish and refine the translation, without adding extra explanations or comments.\n\n## Output\nIn each step of the translation process, output the results to the corresponding XML tags:\n<step1_initial_translation>\n[Insert your initial translation here.]\n</step1_initial_translation>\n<step2_reflection>\n[Insert your reflections on the translation here, and provide specific, useful, and constructive improvement suggestions.
